Hey, Yomi here. I did something very silly. I worked on a production server without proper measures to rollback or recover in the case of an accident. So here I am with a blog site months out of date with a few posts, comments, signups and many drafts lost - I cried.

So, in the near future, I will be migrating from Ghost to a git-based blog site in hopes that I don't put myself in this situation again - I could also stick to using sqlite for Ghost but that's a different topic. I will also look out for a CMS I can use to manage users and do subscriptions like Ghost. I'm open to suggestions as well.

As a result of the loss, I missed out on replying to a few comments. Please feel free to reach out to me directly.
