excerpt: So why Proxmox? Proxmox is a Hypervisor first and foremost and has a lovely web interface to orchestrate a majority of things that would take more steps to do using a terminal. Proxmox also runs Linux, Debian GNU/Linux to be exact.

I did it, I finally did it! I learned a lot from using Linux with Linux Mint and I thought I'd take it a step further. An unfamiliar territory that gave me chills but I ventured into it and scoured the proxmox web interface until I stumbled across a chevron above an underscore. Is this what I think it is, a terminal!? \[Cue dramatic music\]. I then swiftly realised that its not as unfamiliar as I thought.

So why Proxmox? Proxmox is a Hypervisor first and foremost and has a lovely web interface to orchestrate a majority of things that would take more steps to do using a terminal. Proxmox also runs Linux, Debian GNU/Linux to be exact.

To briefly tell you what has changed from my [previous build](https://yomis.blog/sff-server-pc);

**Case:** Metalfish S3 Plus -> Cooler Master NR200 (larger sff case)
**CPU:** i5 10400 -> i9 10900T (QTB0 Engineering sample)
**GPU:** Radeon 5500XT -> Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti (Luckily got it at MSRP)
**Storage Additions:** 2TB 2.5" WD Blue SATA SSD + 1TB Kingston A2000 NVMe Boot SSD + Repurposed 3.5" 2TB Seagate BarraCuda HDD
**Fans:** Many 120mm fans (Mostly by Arctic)
**Antennae:** Cute and small antennae

## Technical Details

Proxmox does things a bit differently to [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org). They both use QEMU/KVM but Proxmox has its own config file and commands which is not dissimilar to [libvirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libvirt) that runs underneath virt-manager. Proxmox also has an extensive built-in support in the web-UI for managing [LXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC), [LVM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)>), [ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS) and recently in PVE 7, [Btrfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs).

Proxmox also makes creating, modifying and assigning networks to guests within the hypervisor very straightforward.

To be continued...
