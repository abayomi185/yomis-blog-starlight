Remember this? [Lily58L](https://yomis.blog/lily58l), I made a new one!

The first keyboard build was great and I still use it but I was looking for something more portable, with shorter key travel and with less height.

As a result this keyboard uses Kailh Choc v1 red and burnt orange switches. The keycaps are MBK with an overall beautiful black aesthetic.

I made only one error whilst building this keyboard, soldering the pins for the Nice!Nano V2 controllers upside down (rookie mistake). This required me to desolder and resolder the pins, a skill I have now improved.

My firmware of choice is still ZMK but I am working towards creating my own firmware in Rust, so watch this space -> [RFMK Firmware - Rust for Mechanical Keyboard](https://github.com/abayomi185/rfmk_firmware)

As of publishing this post, the OLED displays do not work and I have not taken the time to intricately investigate it. So far, I have been using it as I would the Lily58L with the added bonus of extra long battery life; the [ZMK power profiler](https://zmk.dev/power-profiler) estimates 2 months+ which I have been unable to confirm just yet.

This build used the Lily58 Pro kit from [Mechboards.co.uk](https://mechboards.co.uk/), my No. 1 spot for keyboard parts with quick delivery and decent stock (Not sponsored).
